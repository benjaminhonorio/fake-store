# Fake Store

This project puts into practice what I've learnt during half way the full-time training with Make It Real coding bootcamp.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS Flexbox
- Javascript
- React

## Installation

Go to root and do:

`npm install`

## Run Server

In development I used json-server with a json file to serve data to not bother [fakestore api](https://fakestoreapi.com/) with infinite requests. So need to do:

`npm run server`

## Run Application

Open new terminal at root and do:

`npm start`
